                        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

                        Supabase is another open source alternative to Firebase, and the main difference is that it is a SQL database rather than NoSQL. Many users love it because it also offers real-time data, authentication for multiple services, file storage, and more.
